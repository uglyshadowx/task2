                        Badminton is a racquet sport played using rackets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are 'singles' (with one player per side) and 'doubles' (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; professional games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court, within the set boundaries.

                    <h3 class="sidebar-title">Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>You know how badminton seems fast? Well, the world record for the fastest smash is absolutely wild. It's held by India's Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who blasted a shuttlecock at a staggering 565 km/h (that's 351 mph). To put that in perspective, it's significantly faster than the top speed of a Formula 1 car.

But here’s the really interesting part, especially if you think about the physics of it. Unlike a ball, a shuttlecock is an aerodynamic marvel designed to slow down. That cone shape with the 16 feathers creates massive drag. So, while it can leave the racket like an absolute bullet, it decelerates dramatically fast. This is why the game isn't just about raw power; it's a game of exploiting physics, where something can go from 500 km/h to a gentle float in just a fraction of a second.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Badminton's origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where games involving shuttlecocks and rackets were played in various forms. The modern version of badminton, however, began to take shape in the mid-19th century in British India. British officers stationed there encountered a local game called "Poona," which involved hitting a shuttlecock over a net. They brought the game back to England, where it gained popularity among the upper classes. The Bath Badminton Club, established in 1877, was one of the first formal organizations dedicated to the sport. In 1893, the Badminton Association of England was founded, and the first official set of rules was published. The sport quickly spread across Europe and North America, leading to the establishment of national and international governing bodies. Badminton made its Olympic debut as a demonstration sport in 1972 and became an official Olympic sport in 1992 at the Barcelona Games. Today, badminton is played worldwide, with a strong following in countries like China, Indonesia, South Korea, Denmark, and Malaysia. The Badminton World Federation (BWF) oversees international competitions and promotes the sport globally.</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, Laws of Badminton.</p>
            <h3>Court</h3>
            <p><strong>1.Scoring System: </strong>A match consists of the best of three games. Each game is played to 21 points, and a player must win by at least a 2-point margin. If the score reaches 20-20, the game continues until one player leads by 2 points, up to a maximum of 30 points.</p>
            <p><strong>2.Serving Rules:</strong> The server must stand within the service court and hit the shuttlecock below waist height. In singles, the server serves from the right side when their score is even and from the left side when their score is odd. In doubles, the serving side alternates between partners.</p>
            <p><strong>3.Court Boundaries: </strong>The court is divided into two halves by a net. In singles, the entire width of the court is used, while in doubles, the outer sidelines are used. The back boundary line is used for both singles and doubles.</p>
            <p><strong>Faults </strong>A fault occurs if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The shuttlecock lands outside the designated court boundaries.</li>
                <li>The shuttlecock passes through or under the net</li>
                <li>The shuttlecock touches a player's body or clothing</li>
                <li>A player touches the net with their racket or body during play</li>
                <li>The shuttlecock is hit before it crosses the net on a serve</li>
                
            </ul>
